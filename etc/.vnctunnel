Starting SSH tunnel to the VNC server...

Please load a VNC viewer on your local machine (e.g., TurboVNC or TigerVNC),
and connect to the following host:

    localhost:$host_port

The viewer will ask for a *one-time* password. Use the following:

    $(/usr/local/bin/vncpasswd -display :$host_disp -o |& cut -d ' ' -f5)

If you need to generate another one-time password for this session,
use the query sub-command in vncmgr.

This terminal session will hang until the tunnel is killed.
To kill the tunnel, simply type C-c/Control-C.
Make sure you close TurboVNC before you kill the tunnel!
